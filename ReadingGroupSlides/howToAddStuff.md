In order to add your slides, either links or PDFs it is enough to add the file in the folder "slideFiles", and then link it in the "slides.md" file. As an example, one can write
- [Example](slideFiles/slides10OctDavide.pdf).

For links, it is enough to write something like [Link to Google](google.com). 

One can also link to other markdown files, simply as [Link to main file](slides.md).
