Title : **Contractive Systems Inspired GNNs**
 
Brief abstract : Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as a key component in addressing diverse graph-based tasks. Despite their notable successes, GNNs remain susceptible to input perturbations in the form of adversarial attacks. In this talk we present a new approach to fortify GNNs against adversarial perturbations through the lens of contractive dynamical systems.
